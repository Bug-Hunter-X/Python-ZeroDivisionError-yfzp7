# Python ZeroDivisionError Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The bug occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero, resulting in a runtime error.

## Bug Description
The `function` attempts to divide `a` by `b`. If `b` is zero, a ZeroDivisionError is raised. The provided code shows this error explicitly.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero. This can be done by adding a simple `if` statement to verify that the denominator is not equal to zero.
